## part 1

The assembly code provided by CD-ROM will not run correctly, for the end of the sector must has the value of AA55 so that it will be regarded as an boot sector.

I have no idea about how to solve this problem in a smarter way so I simply made a Makefile like this to do so.

## part 2

The bochsrc should be modified to match your bochs version.

I didn't changed the Makefile.
